<p>
  Calling the all-electric 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan electrifying is an easy pun, but it's also entirely accurate. Imagine a roomier and quieter S-class that has a dazzling digital grille and a glowing pinstripe that circles the entire car. While our expectations are based on the company's Vision EQS concept car, we expect many of its impressive characteristics to translate to the production version. The luxurious EV should have a driving range of about 300 miles, two powerful electric motors that enable all-wheel drive, and the ability to pilot itself on the highway. Along with an eco-friendly and high-class interior, the 2022 EQS could be the fanciest electric vehicle on the market when it goes on sale.
